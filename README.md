- **[Sales Dynamics and Shipping Efficiency Analysis](https://github.com/sophisticated21/Sales-Dynamics-and-Shipping-Efficiency-Analysis):** In this project, I utilized SQL for data extraction and cleaning, conducted an A/B test in Python to assess the impact of shipping modes on sales, and visualized outcomes using PowerBI. This analysis provided actionable insights into customer purchasing behaviors, guiding data-driven decisions in retail strategy. 
- **[An Analysis of House Ads Campaign Effectiveness](https://github.com/sophisticated21/An-Analysis-of-House-Ads-Campaign-Effectiveness):** I conducted a detailed analysis of our January 2018 marketing campaign data, with a particular focus on evaluating conversion rate trends. This involved retrieving data using SQL queries, conducting initial explorations, and performing data cleaning. I handled the data using Python and emphasized visualization of the conversion rates through Matplotlib to identify any potential declines. My analysis aimed to uncover any contributing factors to changes in conversion rates and understand the underlying causes. I reported my findings and visualized the data using PowerBI(ongoing).
- **Customer Attrition Analysis for Credit Card Portfolio (Term Project):** I aimed to identify patterns and predict customer churn by analyzing customer data using SQL and Python. My focus was on extracting insights to formulate effective strategies for reducing attrition rates.
- **[Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/sophisticated21/Market-Basket-Analysis):** I concentrated on understanding customer purchasing patterns to enhance sales strategies by implementing an algorithm. This project underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing marketing efforts.
- **[Customer Segmentation]**(https://github.com/sophisticated21/Customer-Segmentation---UCI-Online-Retail-II): My goal was to refine marketing strategies and boost sales through data-driven insights. I transformed extensive sales data into actionable information by employing customer segmentation. Using the K-means clustering technique, I identified distinct customer groups, enabling more targeted and effective marketing efforts. This initiative highlights the power of data analytics in segmenting customers to improve marketing approaches and drive sales growth.
- **B2B Sales and Customer Insight Analysis:** I focused on securing and analyzing transactional datasets to enhance B2B sales strategies and customer insights. My activities included data pre-processing for quality, analyzing sales trends over time, and evaluating the impact of payment behaviors on order values. I implemented customer segmentation for targeted marketing, conducted Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis to prioritize efforts, and performed Market Basket Analysis to identify cross-selling opportunities. The results were compiled into actionable insights to drive strategic and operational improvements.
- **Comprehensive Retail Insights for Supermarkets** I conducted an extensive examination of retail sales data, analyzing performance across various dimensions including states, cities, customer types, shipping modes, and product categories. This project was centered on compiling and visualizing data to understand the complexities of the retail landscape. By examining sales and profit margins across these different aspects, I identified performance trends, highlighting areas and product types that were either thriving or underperforming. The core of this initiative was the extensive use of data visualization, which transformed raw data into a detailed story, unveiling valuable insights to enhance sales strategies and boost profitability.
  
### Environmental Sustainability
- **Comprehensive Analysis and Assistance for Emissions Reduction**: I utilized Python for detailed data analysis, segmentation, and predictive modeling to assist client companies in reducing their emissions. I conducted an extensive evaluation based on attributes like location and industry, gauging their progress towards emissions reduction goals. I implemented machine learning to forecast future reduction potentials and collaborated directly with businesses to address environmental challenges. I developed visualizations to clearly present my findings and compiled a comprehensive report to guide actionable strategies.
- **Fuel Consumption and Emission Analysis**: I focused on dissecting 2022 model year vehicle data, scrutinizing engine specifications, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. The core of this project was to uncover pivotal factors influencing vehicle emissions and efficiency, steering towards insights for sustainable vehicle design and usage. I leveraged Python for meticulous data processing and analysis, complemented by advanced visualization in PowerBI, to reveal critical patterns and relationships that could inform strategies for reducing vehicular environmental impacts.
